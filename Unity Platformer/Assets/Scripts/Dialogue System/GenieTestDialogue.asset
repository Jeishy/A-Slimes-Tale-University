  sentences:
  - I am the genie of this lamp! You have summoned me here to grant you a wish, I
    presume?
  - Ah, you wish to get through the gate to the cave of treasures! Well, that shouldn't
    be a problem, your wish is my... COMMAND!
  - Bwahahaha how do you like being a slime? Getting through the door should be no
    problem at all now *snickers* have fun suffering till you die!
