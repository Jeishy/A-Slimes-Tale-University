  sentences:
  - I've placed 4 gemstones around the map, with shrines that contain elements that
    you may "absorb" due to the make-up of your... rather unfortunate state, haha..
  - Collect them all, and return back to the control room. More suprises await you!
  - But beware, some of my weaker minions wonder this dungeon. Try not to die too
    soon!
